# Farcaster-analysis


This is where i'll store all the Farcaster related analyses and codes that i've created so far. I'll also try to add more work in the future. A lot of the work is messy but i am sure that everything works properly. Please mention it to me if i have accidentally shown any api keys. 


- Paragraph_report_1.ipynb contains most of the code that i used for building this [report](https://paragraph.xyz/@yesyes/farcaster-network-analysis)

- add_list.txt contains the list of FC addresses - a few weeks old now

- Zora.ipynb contains to get the number of FC users that have transacted atleast one on ZORA chain
